# Example Nginx conf

This is an nginx.conf I created through the years. It serves as a starting point for your own Nginx installs.

SSL settings (partly) based on modern Nginx settings at https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/

You can use [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) to implement SSL in the proxy config.
